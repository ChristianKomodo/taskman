# **Taskman**
### Example Single Page Application in AngularJS

This example web application displays 6 tasks chosen at random from a total of 10 each time the user visits the page.  Tasks can be marked complete by clicking on them.  Progress is shown on the animated progress circle.  The user can also change the size and gradient colors of the progress circle in the Settings page.  Changes made do not affect the progress and which tasks were marked complete on the home page.
